   THIS IS THE HELP FILE FOR SUPERSEEKER
*************************************************************

Greetings from "superseeker".   This program will accept a
sequence of integers and try very hard to find an explanation.


Superseeker makes use of many things, some of which are:

1. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (or OEIS)
                   N. J. A. Sloane
        AT&T Research Labs, Florham Park, NJ 07932-0971 USA
- see http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/Seis.html

2. The "gfun" Maple package of Bruno Salvy and Paul Zimmermann.

3. A Mathematica program from Olivier Gerard to carry out various
sequence transformations.

4. Harm Derksen's program "guesss", which uses Pade'-Hermite approximations
- see http://www.maplesoft.com/CyberMath/share/guesss.html.
That algorithm is described in:
An algorithm to compute generalized Pade'-Hermite forms,
Report 9403 (1994), Dept. of Math., Catholic University Nijmegen
(available from http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hderksen/preprints/pade.ps).

5. Christian Kratthentaler's Mathematica program Rate which tries to 
guess a closed form for a sequence ("rate" is "guess" in German).
For a description of Rate, see
http://radon.mat.univie.ac.at/People/kratt/rate/rate.html.

6. John Linderman's program CheckSeq.pl which checks if
there is a partial overlap between a sequence and any
sequence in the database.

7. Various other programs.


INSTRUCTIONS:
To submit a sequence to superseeker, send mail to

superseeker@research.att.com

containing a single line of the form

   lookup 1 2 4 6 10 14 20 26 36 46 60 74 94 114

in the body of the message. In the Subject line, say "none".

The terms must be separated by spaces (not commas).
It is best to give between 10 and 20 terms.

Only one request may be submitted at a time, and (since this
program does some serious computing), only one request per user
per hour.  (There is a list of special users who are exempt from
this restriction.  If you feel you have a genuine need to be
placed on this list, send mail to njas@research.att.com, giving
your reasons!)

[To simply look up sequences in the Encyclopedia, it is 
more efficient to use either the email server at
   
   sequences@research.att.com

- send an empty email message to that address to get instructions-
or the Web server at

   http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/  ]



RECOMMENDATIONS:
. Start from the beginning of the sequence (although of course
	keep in mind that different people may define the zero-th
	term (say) in different ways

. Minus signs (if any) should be INCLUDED, since most of the
	programs will make use of them

. If you receive 30 matches from the Encyclopedia, try again
	giving more terms

. If you give too many terms, it will tie up my machine for a long
        time, and my boss will be unhappy

. For an array of numbers, try looking up the individual
	rows, columns or diagonals, whichever seem appropriate

. The program is (mostly) concerned only with infinite sequences

. The program only handles integers.  (For a sequence of
	rationals, try the sequences of numerators and
	denominators separately.)

. The word "lookup" may only appear once in the message
        The "Subject" line is thrown away.


TESTS USED

The program will apply some or all of the following tests.
(The program gives up once it has found a sufficient number
of possible explanations.  The more trivial the sequence,
the less time the program will spend studying it.
Also some of these tests are not applicable to all sequences.
Only potentially useful results are reported.)

. Look up in the On-Line Encyclopedia both the sequence and the sequence
	with the first term omitted.
    	(The reply will report all matches found, up to a limit of 30.)

. Test if a(n) is a polynomial in n  [a(n) denotes the n-th term]
    	In other words, are the differences of some order constant?

. Test if the differences of some order are periodic.
    	(Suppose the kth order differences are  d(1), ...,d(n).
    	They are said to be periodic if there is a number p, the period,
    	with 1 <= p <= n-2, such that d(i) = d(j) whenever i = j (mod p).)

. Test if any row of the difference table of some depth is essentially
    	constant.  This detects such sequences as 4^n - n^4.
	(Let the usual difference table be
            a(0), a(1), a(2), ...
		b(0), b(1), ...
           	    c(0), c(1), ...
              		....
	This is the difference table of depth 1. The table of depth 2
	has as top row
		a(0), b(0), c(0), ...;
	and so on.)

. For a 2-valued sequence, compute the six characteristic sequences
	associated with the sequence and look them up in the OEIS.
        (Suppose the sequence takes only the values X and Y.
        The six characteristic sequences, all equivalent to the original, are:
           replace X,Y by 1,2; by 2,1;
           the positions of the X's, of the Y's;
           the run lengths;
           and the derivative, i.e. the positions where the sequence changes.)

. Form the generating functions (g.f.) for the sequence for each of
	the following 6 types:

	ogf	ordinary generating function
	egf	exponential generating function
	revogf	reversion of ordinary generating function
	revegf	reversion of exponential generating function
	lgdogf	logarithmic derivative of ordinary generating function
	lgdegf	logarithmic derivative of exponential generating function

    	and attempt to represent them as rational functions,
    	hypergeometric series, or the solution to a linear differential
    	equation with polynomial coefficients.

. Look for a linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients for the
    	coefficients of the above 6 types of g.f.'s.

. Look for a polynomial equation in y and x for the g.f. y(x) of each
    	of the above 6 types.

. Apply the transformations listed below to the sequence and look up
  	the result in the OEIS.  Stop when 50 matches have been found.

. Test if the sequence is a Beatty sequence.
	  (A Beatty sequence is one in which the n-th term is [nz],
	where z is irrational.  The complementary sequence is [ny],
	where 1/x + 1/y = 1.  Refs: N. J. A. Sloane,
	Handbook of Integer Sequences, 1973, p. 29; R. Honsberger,
	Ingenuity in Mathematics, 1970, p. 93.  If this is a Beatty
	sequence the value given for z will produce the given terms,
	but is very far from being unique.)

COMMON ERRORS WHEN USING THIS EMAIL SERVICE:
Make sure that
the word "lookup" does not appear in the message in the same line as
any non-numeric characters.  Make sure that the lookup line
has the form

   lookup 1 4 9 16 25                     GOOD!

and avoid any lines that say things like:

Subject: lookup please                                        BAD!
Subject: lookup                                               BAD!
To: lookup <sequences@research.att.com>                       BAD!
   lookup 1,4,9,16,...      [NO COMMAS OR DOTS ARE ALLOWED!]  BAD!
   lookup 1 4 9 16 ?                                          BAD!

In a submission to superseeker the word "lookup" may only
appear once in the entire message.
